===============================

About
-----

SQLite is a de-facto standard lightweight database engine present in almost every software you know, included DVD Players.
Thanks to its performances, features, and portability, SQLite has been adopted by almost every browser, included Mozilla Family.
Unfortunately Mozilla folks decided to do not expose SQLite through the Web SQL Database interface defined by W3C and adopted by any other browser with the lovely exception of Internet Explorer.

With **db.js** the problem is solved: **SQLite Is Back** and with a nicely, simplified, and intuitive interface.
